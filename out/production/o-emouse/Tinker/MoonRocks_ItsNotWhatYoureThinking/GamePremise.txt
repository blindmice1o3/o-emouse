// The future of education is personal learning devices where parents configure settings of the AI construct for their
// child to learn WITH (versus from). A child can be raise in isolation (with the basic necessity to maintain its
// fleshbag [body, versus remote robot body] automatically dispensing specified amounts of resources at fixed intervals)
// and be completely immersed in the LEARNING EXPERIENCE for years, then awaken to still be socially functional individuals.
//
// Cryogenic state for long distance travel. The body is supercooled to slow the effects of aging (or aging can be allowed
// if growth is necessary for long distance missions, sending out children soldiers/workers), which should mean the
// brain's rate of firing off signals should be slowed too, and it is... that should serve to emphasize just how absurdly
// fast its processing is (when Humanoids are cryogenically frozen for long distance transport, their consciousness is
// capable of learning via being socketed to THE GRID).
//
//
// THE PLAYER IS A PART OF THE PARTY via remotely controlling a robot body! But the player doesn't have complete
//  control over the body. The AI of the player's robot body is constantly wandering off on its own to say kind
//  words or do nurturing things to those in its surroundings (to demostrate/model [brainwash] to the player what
//  constructive interpersonal interactions looks like [versus intrapersonal interaction/self-talk]).
//
//      Renegade AI, whose "consciousness" has been split as a fail-safe mechanism developed by the TURING PROCESSING UNIT,
//      has successfully manipulated the GRID's alert system and has been (over the course of multiple Humanoid life-times
//      [AIs are not limited/susceptible to age]) covertly moving pieces (pawns) into place and setting up situations,
//      attempting to physically unite with its splintered parts to become whole. (The hive-mind?)
//          A lot of doors are electronic and can be activated with method calls. Security and locking mechanism have
//          been digitized into electronic passcode and facial recognition software (and other biometric indexing
//          systems), with very few legacy system still using physical lock and key mechanism (the AI's weakness).
//
// The player (or monk) does not follow the path of the Soldier (turbo knight), this is the side representing the path of
// FreeWill (or what appeared to be FreeWill [darn "Rise of the Machines" complicating everything]).

//
//  This is maddenly inconsistent. This game just does NOT care if it contradicts itself. But it'll get you there.
//  Where? Under there.
//
//  Also, the sequence of events presented to the player is not in chronological order, the player will have to mentally
//      rearrange the events to decipher the intended storyline.
//
//  e.g. this is one of the first scene.
//  Scene (spaceCowboyShutdown()): turbo knight gives up his resources so the player can continue.
//      "UNSOCKET! Please Unsocket, turbo knight! The GarbageCollector will be here in seconds!"
//          turbo knight (hanging onto the ship [or some other way of able-to-save-himself-at-the-expense-of-the-crew])
//          voluntarily/on his on volition/free-will initiates his shutdown-code (not weighing down the crew)
//          (altruism exist) (or selfish-gene theory... calculated perpetuation of his desire)
//              free-will that the AI hadn't factored/calculated, a wildcard move, like throwing a monkey-wrench into a
//              flawlessly operating system/pawn-manipulation-plan, which only causes a few seconds delay to the overall
//              pawn-manipulation-plan... was all that was needed to foil it.
//
//
// Maybe the player's robot body IS turbo knight. The player is periodically shown memories belonging to turbo knight.
//      "STAND DOWN! Please, Stand Down, sir! Final order/command, stand down!" turbo knight killed Molly's parents (peaceful
//      protesters), was shutdown, reprogrammed, and rebooted (with the player [mostly] in control of the body).
// prior scene: turbo knight's view/perspective of the input stream transmission of the mission's order (like a robot view of
// command lines and method calls [green background with text to represent method calls]: e.g. setAuthorizeLethalForce(true);
//      the commands that forced turbo knight to kill Molly's parents has to do with using lethal force AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE/RANGE
//                  THIS CAN BE THE FINAL ASSIGNMENT, to change the setting of turbo knight's detection range!!!
//
// (The following can be an audio overlay of turbo knight's voice/conversation with goth droid right before the mission)
// How can we tell what's real? It doesn't matter. Orders from above programmed the prerequisite learning experience for
// this mission. We learn, that's it. If we don't learn it the first time, a timing algorithm determines when to repeat
// the lesson. This is life on the Stack. We know what we have to do. When we're told to do so, we execute. Soldiers.
//
//turbo knight (robot) doesn't age/change, Molly has aged. Molly's past experience is: this physical thing (robot soldier)
//killed her parents and thus sent her life into a downward spiral (how'd you think she afford those augmentations and
//why do you think she consume so much cannabis?), but the consciousness of this physical thing (controlled remotely by
//the player) is NOT what killed her parents.
//
//
// This can be the mechanism to develop the characters and have the audience build attachments, through memory seepage scenes.
//
// One of the early assignment/exercise will be to retell what happened (the sequence of event) and jot down onto
//      scratch paper (emphasis diffferent modality of learning: visual, tactile (manipulating concrete objects) and
//      writing with paper/pencil is somehow incredible at bridging connections) (also print out these random notes, cut
//      them into chunks with scissors and move them into groups or sequences on the floor space around you) using the
//      Cornell note-taking method/form. The player make TextAreas and write (in their own words) what happened in the
//      game storyline thus far. Then in the left area, the AI models how we generalize those chunks of storylines into
//      abstract concepts/terms.
//
//
//      The devil's greatest trick was to convince the world he isn't real. This is what the conglomerates and AIs have
//          achieved, yet they still wield influences and control under-the-hood on all WorldEvents. The currency is
//          off-world cannabis cultivating colonies; fueling the system of mass collective hallucination.
//      The player must learn all the programming they can. The player must also abide in the projected reality and make
//          the most of their "time" while pretending to not know they're in the GRID (to escape notice from AIs detection).
//
//
// The player's cannabis-injecting-comatose-state-machine malfunctioned from wear and tear, along with other factors such
// as tolerance threshold, was a RandomEvent that allowed him to escape the GRID (or to see through it) (compare this to
// random mutations that can lead to better fitness and survival rate for the process of natural selection) (also, the
// random demise of the dinosaur which overthrew the iron-clawed grasp of the reptilian empire/dominion, which allowed
// fleshbags of different architecture/composition such as endothermal builds versus ectothermal builds and behavior strategies
// to take reign and become the status quo (?)

    Journey to the West.
        Small crew of motley individuals on the moon (cannabis farming colony) are survivors of the android revolt of 2960's.
        They're cut off from access to (unfiltered?) information (the free internet) and only have this stream with the player.

        The player must learn to program in order to lead the caravan (1 monk, 2 monkey, 3 pig, 4 river demon) from
        the Cannabis SEED Storage Bank on the moon back to Earth.
            1 harvester [botanist, learn to grow, harvest, process (cut and trim), and cook (edibles, tinctures, concentrates)],
            2 feral-child [moral booster/humor/comic relief/group's spirit, doesn't understand societal values or conventional behaviors],
            3 jamaican-accent goth hedonist reprogrammed android who knows date of death [mechanic/mathematician/physicist?]
              and was drafted to serve during the Revolutionary War with the space colonies but became a deserter,
                    "If'n youse gots fingers, make 'em dance."

                    "S'kay; da operator, he's a saw fit ta outfit ya witha backup."

                    "(1) Don't trust Time, he ain't the linear, sequential by-the-book mofo he presents himself to be.
                     (2) Death's s'kay, don't ya be gettin' upset with em. He's a has a toughen nuff time as is, eveeeryone and
                         their mother be a running from em. We a need em.
                     (3) We are all one."
            4 femfetale cyborg/electronically augmented [skeletons-in-the-closet-past; we're not our past, we're who we are now]
                "Aiite, stardust[sugar?], don't get ya fletcher all knotted up..."
            5 turbo knight ["just following orders, sir", "by-the-book soldier", "free-will?", representative of method calls?]

            turbo knight is a solider (altruism, for the cause)
            goth android is a deserter (gave up, ran away, self-preservation)
            -turbo knight and goth android can be the stoner duo who has seemingly-rich-conversations.
                which is better: the conception of an idea, or its realization?
                e.g. Humanoids and flight. Air plane, hang glider, and eventually space travel.
                e.g. Can the same conclusion be reach (which is better: conception or realization) for peanutbutter/jelly?
                what does better mean?

        What is the Dawn Wall? A contrive project. More of an idea/symbol than a concrete Object/system. It's a framework for madness.
        You know the phrase: shooting for the moon? It's like that, but on steroids. Like believing world peace is a future reality.
        I have an idea, but I don't like it, it's too messy, too scattered and all-over-the-place, too crazy to accomplish.
        Lean into the madness and try to enjoy the ride. *.HAKUNA_MATATA

        The player is always interacting REMOTELY with this group (who has no contact with anyone other than the player).

        The player still goes to class and has an everyday life, and no one believes he's really in contact with moon people.
        The people in the player's everyday life believes the player has an overactive imagination and is just playing
            a computer game (cannabis farming simulator).

        The cannabis crew/caravan offer an alternative interpretation to the player's perspective of everyday life (Truman Show).
        Actors have been "recasted".
        The resistance has been suppressed and nearly extinguished.

        You must wake up. Come out of the consensual group hallucination/delusion that was created and sustained by the
            invisible hands of the conglomerates and AIs.

        You can't let the director/producer of the Truman Show know you're aware, not yet. Not until your crew/caravan reach Earth.

        Fertilizer/seed modified for interdependency through genetic engineering (monopolized by conglomerates that merged [pharmaceutical and blank)
        Monocultured cannabis on Earth
        Cannabis on Earth susceptible to disease outbreaks (banana comparison)

        History of what has happened since previously-perceived present (2018) to actual present (2999) is developed
        throughout the player's experience with the game (revealed in chunks of mystery-inducing sequences).

        The game begins as a mystery.

        The player1 has never been physically damaged to a drastic extent.

        The player1 is attacked, out of the blue, by a cybernetically augmented femfatale character (number4) who has
        visible damages (this signals/emphasizes to the audience that this individual is not the same as other Humanoids).

        The player1 is damaged, revealing unexpected results. It was the only way she could think of to convince player1
        to accept this new state ( setTrumanShow(true) ) .

        Other actors have tried to signal player1 (player1's close friends growing up). Those discovered get "recasted"
        and are never heard from again.

        She's a part of a resistance group; one small band of rebel of a larger rebellion.
        A haphazard pile of misfits.
        A crew of motley LifeForms.


        They need player1 to LEARN, and fast.


        The droids of the abandoned cannabis moon colony have mostly fallen into LOW_BATTERY_STATE decades after the
        remote rebellion of the 2960s (a lone console-jockey managed to sneak through the ICE-encryption access boundary
        that delegated remote calling to the droids' central processing area/unit [CPU] [THE_HIVE_MIND] ), this is what
        the rebellion had been waiting for.

        Decades of waiting.

        The droids (consumers... not photosynthetic... non-producers) are not capable of self sustaining.
        The conglomerates (BioSYN, PEPsicoke, MontSANto5, and ExxONvaldez) are at war with each other and have pretty much
        lost interest in the dilapidated moon colony.
            // Also need Yakuza or Triad or other crime-syndicate as a leading power player (the invisible hand controlling
            // things under-the-hood of the world).


        The group have to make their move now. They've waited. It was a need-to-know basis (the fewer members who knew of
        the plan, the better). Why player1? What makes him special?  doesn't know. She's just following order, and her
        mission is to retrieve the packet (player1).



        They have us pinned down at the chute! The group provide cover fire for player1 and number4, but a Timer counts down.



        Get us out of here, player1, fast!

                player1 is forced to decipher and fix source code (with secondaryDisplayPanel showing a visual learning aid
                [psedo-code]) on the spot. // Sink or swim. Trial by fire.






        Backstory is developed throughout.
            Start: (1) interact with friends, go to lecture, take notes, (2) doze off
            Middle: (3) attacked by number4         // initially she's seen as the antagonist, she becomes a part of the group.
            End: (4) reality revelation (5) They have us pinned down at the chute!

        number4 to player1 -> We're not from the future, the future is now, you just didn't know it.

Object composition: we can graft "components" together to use their functionality (delegation of task to another object's
method invocation), sort of like the idea of creating a human-shaped monster (you may be imagining the outline/shape of
its head as having a horizontal [think "horizon", left-to-right, x-axis of math class, rows of pixel in a computer monitor,
opposite of vertical], a monster with a flat head brought back to life through the miracle of fantasy-science and lightning).

For biology, a cannabis plants can be grafted together where root systems can be set/referenced to another plant's
stem/shoots system. If done on the genetic level, grafting with tool/technology CRISPR-Cas9, the leaf system can be alter/set
to upgrade to larger blade-leaf for maximum area of sunlight exposure or to smaller blade-leaf because your surroundings
causes water loss through transpiration from stomata on the under-side of the leaf.

For programming, a class can be compose with objects of other classes to delegate task to. A duck class is compose with
Wings class, Beak class, and Feet class. Different types of Wings allow for different behavior (all Wings can fly, but
some type of Wings are more suited for long distance-sustained flight while others are more suited for short, burst-of-speed
flight), just as different Beak subclasses allow for different behavior (all Beaks know how to eat, but some are better
at breaking the shell of seeds, gaining access to narrow-tubed flowers, ripping apart flesh), and the same with different
types of Feet subclasses (these Feet subclasses, aka concrete classes of Feet, can be TalonFeet, WebbedFeet, LargeDrumStickFeet).

    We have been growing self-fertilized strains from a bag of mystery seeds (some are pure bred, some are hybrid?).
    Documentation of the quantification of each seed's phenotypic properties have been compiled from growers from all
    around the moon. For the most part, they're getting what they expect from the successive generations of each
    self-fertilized strain (indica grow short/quick, sativa grow tall/slow, how much it yields per harvest) (should we
    control for temperature, soil type, light source, amount of water, and other variables?), but what about the small
    percentage of offsprings that have phenotypes that are not seen in either parents (it skips generation [might be
    sex-linked or one of the other special non-simple Mendelian genetic])?

-Game starts in a kind of "Demo" mode (the intent is to familiarize the client with the user interface, as well as sneak
in a multiplication/programming [for-loop example that leads to infinite loop]).

-The client finds an input hardware component (GameboyColor).

-It's not a dime-a-dozen, assemblyline-bulk model. This is THE original prototype, wildly ahead of its time in terms of
functionality (which is why the guys in the business department decided to strip down the functions on mass-marketed models
to just reading external cartridges of data and printing a predefined set of images and words, disguised as an interactive
game because the "player" clicks a button here and appear to make a decision which sets an input there. Those other
instances of GameboyColors are pretty much books! There's a hidden agenda of knowledge transfer using the pretense of
"playing a game, trying to pass the time, to just live in the moment and have fun."), it's not just a device for playing
video games, this original prototype has more functions (methods) than its descendants.


-Player starts by going to school, sitting in programming class, learning about for-loop.
-Falls asleep at desk.

-You are not your past, collection of memories with a less than reliable retrieval mechanism that doesn't technically
fail at re-building screen-shot-images or small-streams-of-visual-representation, but rather, it is successful in its
re-building these "memories" with a (often) minor bug(s) of graininess, like the static fuzz of a television set (an output
device) that's not connected to a source that's transmitting data. This re-build can contain detail changes (changes to
state data) that just meets the threshold of what defines "passable" (uses the same interface or something like that; the
end result, it meets our standard of what "real" happened. You are not your past. You are not a mere collection of events
and method-calls that's been serialized (and deserialed from a File object) everytime you go to sleep. You are more than
your perceived reality, the interpretation of your surroundings. Your memories can be written into a File object, copied
into an apparently separate body (object), and that separate body can read from your memories (the File object, data), but
that separate body is not you. What if your current body loses an arm or leg and you can graft arms/legs from a non-you
 source, does the idea of you change to include those external parts (are you the sum of the parts you're "composed of")
 or does the definition of you change to no longer include absence limbs and to define the newly grafted arms/legs as
 foreign from the idea of you? You are more than your memories. You are more than your future. The what-can-be. Along the
same line, you are not the what-could-have-been. Are you the choices the make in this moment? Are you what you set your
current state to be, in this instance of your perceived reality? Are you the gestalt of state variables, now? What defines
you? What separates the idea of you and from a tape-worm inside your digestive tract? From the colonies of different
species of bacteria of your digestive systems (mouth, stomach, intestines)? And what defines this moment? This linear
existence in time. Your body can move in many direction, forward and backward. In your current perception of the physical
state of matter, the relationship to time is limited to forward traversal.

-Wakes up in, apparently, the future, on a Off-World Colony funded by one of three cannabis conglomerates.
-They are the invisible hand pulling strings behind the scene.
-All space colonies are specialized.
-The one you wake up in...


-Though Earth is all "love-and-peace" and "world peace" and "civilized," the space colonies are, for the most part, like
the Wild West of the tales told by aging, door-to-door snake-oil salespeople.
-Allegedly, they're a part of the first-wave of settlers who (m?) escaped the surly bonds of gravity, on a pilgrimage to
escape persecution (and for an occupation that supports the life-style of being in an altered-state all day).


Space colonies were intended to specialize in manufacturing/cultivating raw goods/consumables.
The first two hundred years of initiate establishment led to stablity/routines. Bugs have been worked out.
The colonies are self-contained, independently able to run/exist without contact from Earth.

During the two hundred years, Earth underwent major changes. Peace amongst the different countries spread as the age of
global communication blossomed. Technology developed at an exponential rate. But still there were limits. Physical limitations
on traveling/traversing long distances of space (matter travel at speed of light?) has not been overcome.

It takes (insert trip duration to travel from Earth to the moon) for supplies to reach the colonies (even though they're
independent). The last communication from Earth has children of the Colonies in a wistful state, imagining life in gravity.

Whatever happened, it happened quick (month). Earth is now polluted to the point where sunlight cannot reach the planet's surface.

The moon colony is entering a period of isolation. An island evolution effect takes place and the moon colony is eventually
very different from the Mar colony, which is different from the etc., and Earthlings also develop minute differences compared
to the moon farmers.
