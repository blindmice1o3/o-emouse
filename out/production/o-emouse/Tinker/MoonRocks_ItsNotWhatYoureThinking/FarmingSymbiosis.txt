Genetic editing tools and technology such as CRISPR-Cas9 initially allowed humans the opportunity to alter sequences of
germ-line cell (as oppose to somatic cells) for whole-system-level changes; suddenly, instances of humans contain genetic
sequences (group of statements stored as methods/functions) not found in its parent, but across the horizontal branches of
the hierarchical tree.


Symbiosis (Wikipedia)
"In a cleaning symbiosis, the clownfish feeds on small invertebrates that otherwise have potential to harm the sea anemone,
and the fecal matter from the clownfish provides the nutrients to the sea anemone. The clownfish is protected from predators
by the anemone's stinging cells, to which the clownfish is immune. The clownfish emits a high pitched sound that deters
butterfly fish, which would otherwise eat the anemone, making the relationship appear mutualistic."


The Special Variable super (http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s6.html#OOP.6.2)
"Let's say that the class that you are writing contains an instance method named doSomething(). Consider the subroutine
call statement super.doSomething(). Now, super doesn't know anything about the doSomething() method in the subclass. It
only knows about things in the superclass, so it tries to execute a method named doSomething() from the superclass. If
there is none -- if the doSomething() method was an addition rather than a modification -- you'll get a syntax error."
