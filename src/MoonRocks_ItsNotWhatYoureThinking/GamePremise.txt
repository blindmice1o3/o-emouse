    We have been growing self-fertilized strains from a bag of mystery seeds (some are pure bred, some are hybrid?).
    Documentation of the quantification of each seed's phenotypic properties have been compiled from growers from all
    around the moon. For the most part, they're getting what they expect from the successive generations of each
    self-fertilized strain (indica grow short/quick, sativa grow tall/slow, how much it yields per harvest) (should we
    control for temperature, soil type, light source, amount of water, and other variables?), but what about the small
    percentage of offsprings that have phenotypes that are not seen in either parents (it skips generation [might be
    sex-linked or one of the other special non-simple Mendelian genetic])?

-Game starts in a kind of "Demo" mode (the intent is to familiarize the client with the user interface, as well as sneak
in a multiplication/programming [for-loop example that leads to infinite loop]).

-The client finds an input hardware component (GameboyColor).

-It's not a dime-a-dozen, assemblyline-bulk model. This is THE original prototype, wildly ahead of its time in terms of
functionality (which is why the guys in the business department decided to strip down the functions on mass-marketed models
to just reading external cartridges of data and printing a predefined set of images and words, disguised as an interactive
game because the "player" clicks a button here and appear to make a decision which sets an input there. Those other
instances of GameboyColors are pretty much books! There's a hidden agenda of knowledge transfer using the pretense of
"playing a game, trying to pass the time, to just live in the moment and have fun."), it's not just a device for playing
video games, this original prototype has more functions (methods) than its descendants.


-Player starts by going to school, sitting in programming class, learning about for-loop.
-Falls asleep at desk.
-Wakes up in, apparently, the future, on a Off-World Colony funded by one of three cannabis conglomerates.
-They are the invisible hand pulling strings behind the scene.
-All space colonies are specialized.
-The one you wake up in...


-Though Earth is all "love-and-peace" and "world peace" and "civilized," the space colonies are, for the most part, like
the Wild West of the tales told by aging, door-to-door snake-oil salespeople.
-Allegedly, they're a part of the first-wave of settlers who (m?) escaped the surly bonds of gravity, on a pilgrimage to
escape persecution (and for an occupation that supports the life-style of being in an altered-state all day).


Space colonies were intended to specialize in manufacturing/cultivating raw goods/consumables.
The first two hundred years of initiate establishment led to stablity/routines. Bugs have been worked out.
The colonies are self-contained, independently able to run/exist without contact from Earth.

During the two hundred years, Earth underwent major changes. Peace amongst the different countries spread as the age of
global communication blossomed. Technology developed at an exponential rate. But still there were limits. Physical limitations
on traveling/traversing long distances of space (matter travel at speed of light?) has not been overcome. It takes (insert
trip duration to travel from Earth to the moon) for supplies to reach the colonies (even though they're independent).
The last communication from Earth has children of the Colonies in a wistful state, imagining life in gravity. Whatever
happened, it happened quick (month). Earth is now polluted to the point where sunlight cannot reach the planet's surface.
The moon colony is entering a period of isolation. An island evolution effect takes place and the moon colony is eventually
very different from the Mar colony, which is different from the etc., and Earthlings also develop minute differences compared
to the moon farmers.


Time:
-Distance future where the cybernetic-prosthetic-enhancements industry (down to three mega corporations of the
EurAsia continent) is seen as becoming obsolete. Development of Western gene-editting-technology has enable lab-grown
(functional) tissues (skeletal-muscular system) created from a sample collect of the client's cells (in terms of immune
system rejection, this procedure of biosynthetic engineering is generally accepted as being far safer than augmenting the
body with foreign components). A fierce advertising war between the cyborg and bio-splicer (like the visible mushroom
part of fungus or glacier) sets the stage for global war.



Separation/compartmentalization/encapsulation:
-societal role (butcher) enabled the separation of guilt arising from raising/killing live-stocks the masses to a few
individuals who developed specialization at such a skill/service.
-growing crops has also been separated from the layman's consciousness.
-photosynthesis is no longer the dominate process of acquiring/fixing carbon atoms.
-chemosynthesis has been developed out of necessity (extreme levels of atmospheric pollutant prevented sunlight from
 reaching plants), it was the result of the collaborative efforts of the brightest minds of all the world's countries.
 The infrastructure of

Starting point:
-Plateua that is so isolated it's virtually untouched by time. (homeage to "The Lost World")
-Explorer had followed whispers/rumors/folktales and gone in search of the plateua; and returned with cannabis seeds.
-Explorer being chased, gives seeds to player1 (the son of an inn keeper) before dying. (homeage to "Treasure Island")
