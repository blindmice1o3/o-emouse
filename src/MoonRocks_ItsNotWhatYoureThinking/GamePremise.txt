// Ultimately this project's mission is to create something to be use as a test of patience.
// If you sit there and use this program, and end up learning or taking something away that you find useful, good for you!
//
// But at its core, this game is meant to take away seconds of your life.
//
// We can market it as an investment of your time to learn a practical/beneficial skill set that will enhance your future
// predicament, but that's just a nicely decorated, fancy way of saying give up your time now in exchange for a substance-less
// concept that may not even exist (the GARBAGE COLLECTOR may get you three days from now, therefore your three days time
// "investment" is instantly and magically transformed into another form [state], time "regretted"). How is this alchemy
// achieved? It has something to do with the "potential" of the three days (the difference of perceived time-wasted
// versus time-utilized). A caveat to this (which happens to be the key to spiritual contentment) involves: a balance
// between enjoying each moment and recognizing/accepting tradeoffs).
//
// I'm trying to become the villain that this world deserves, but through video games, so like, the Disney version.
//
// The hidden curriculum are lessons related to good citizenship (the intended lessons; the ones that uses life science,
// programming language, human language, history, and math as a vessel to communicate its messages). It is the message
// that is surreptitiously ingrained to the subconsciousness of players of the game (my future minions).

     -CountZeroInit was suppose to be a knock-off of a specific video game (Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue).
     -MoonRocks_ItsNotWhatYoureThinking is suppose to be a knock-off of the idea of video game (it's an educational
        tool poorly disguised as a video game [wolf object composed in a SheepAdapter object]).

        -The production quality of the graphics will be found wanting (use this form of the word "want" as a JDialog or
        pop-up to teach language), and the aim of the ambience is "cutely whimsical for the chronically cynical".
        -The player's guide, the Artificial Intelligence inside the GameboyColor, is a visual/graphical construct of
        predefined statements that are interacting at runtime to the player's "input/stimulus", but this construct is
        basically a jerk, hopefully this will naturally lead to a chronically cynical atmosphere.

Object composition: we can graft "components" together to use their functionality (delegation of task to another object's
method invocation), sort of like the idea of creating a human-shaped monster (you may be imagining the outline/shape of
its head as having a horizontal [think "horizon", left-to-right, x-axis of math class, rows of pixel in a computer monitor,
opposite of vertical], a monster with a flat head brought back to life through the miracle of fantasy-science and lightning).

For biology, a cannabis plants can be grafted together where root systems can be set/referenced to another plant's
stem/shoots system. If done on the genetic level, grafting with tool/technology CRISPR-Cas9, the leaf system can be alter/set
to upgrade to larger blade-leaf for maximum area of sunlight exposure or to smaller blade-leaf because your surroundings
causes water loss through transpiration from stomata on the under-side of the leaf.

For programming, a class can be compose with objects of other classes to delegate task to. A duck class is compose with
Wings class, Beak class, and Feet class. Different types of Wings allow for different behavior (all Wings can fly, but
some type of Wings are more suited for long distance-sustained flight while others are more suited for short, burst-of-speed
flight), just as different Beak subclasses allow for different behavior (all Beaks know how to eat, but some are better
at breaking the shell of seeds, gaining access to narrow-tubed flowers, ripping apart flesh), and the same with different
types of Feet subclasses (these Feet subclasses, aka concrete classes of Feet, can be TalonFeet, WebbedFeet, LargeDrumStickFeet).

    We have been growing self-fertilized strains from a bag of mystery seeds (some are pure bred, some are hybrid?).
    Documentation of the quantification of each seed's phenotypic properties have been compiled from growers from all
    around the moon. For the most part, they're getting what they expect from the successive generations of each
    self-fertilized strain (indica grow short/quick, sativa grow tall/slow, how much it yields per harvest) (should we
    control for temperature, soil type, light source, amount of water, and other variables?), but what about the small
    percentage of offsprings that have phenotypes that are not seen in either parents (it skips generation [might be
    sex-linked or one of the other special non-simple Mendelian genetic])?

-Game starts in a kind of "Demo" mode (the intent is to familiarize the client with the user interface, as well as sneak
in a multiplication/programming [for-loop example that leads to infinite loop]).

-The client finds an input hardware component (GameboyColor).

-It's not a dime-a-dozen, assemblyline-bulk model. This is THE original prototype, wildly ahead of its time in terms of
functionality (which is why the guys in the business department decided to strip down the functions on mass-marketed models
to just reading external cartridges of data and printing a predefined set of images and words, disguised as an interactive
game because the "player" clicks a button here and appear to make a decision which sets an input there. Those other
instances of GameboyColors are pretty much books! There's a hidden agenda of knowledge transfer using the pretense of
"playing a game, trying to pass the time, to just live in the moment and have fun."), it's not just a device for playing
video games, this original prototype has more functions (methods) than its descendants.


-Player starts by going to school, sitting in programming class, learning about for-loop.
-Falls asleep at desk.

-You are not your past, collection of memories with a less than reliable retrieval mechanism that doesn't technically
fail at re-building screen-shot-images or small-streams-of-visual-representation, but rather, it is successful in its
re-building these "memories" with a (often) minor bug(s) of graininess, like the static fuzz of a television set (an output
device) that's not connected to a source that's transmitting data. This re-build can contain detail changes (changes to
state data) that just meets the threshold of what defines "passable" (uses the same interface or something like that; the
end result, it meets our standard of what "real" happened. You are not your past. You are not a mere collection of events
and method-calls that's been serialized (and deserialed from a File object) everytime you go to sleep. You are more than
your perceived reality, the interpretation of your surroundings. Your memories can be written into a File object, copied
into an apparently separate body (object), and that separate body can read from your memories (the File object, data), but
that separate body is not you. What if your current body loses an arm or leg and you can graft arms/legs from a non-you
 source, does the idea of you change to include those external parts (are you the sum of the parts you're "composed of")
 or does the definition of you change to no longer include absence limbs and to define the newly grafted arms/legs as
 foreign from the idea of you? You are more than your memories. You are more than your future. The what-can-be. Along the
same line, you are not the what-could-have-been. Are you the choices the make in this moment? Are you what you set your
current state to be, in this instance of your perceived reality? Are you the gestalt of state variables, now? What defines
you? What separates the idea of you and from a tape-worm inside your digestive tract? From the colonies of different
species of bacteria of your digestive systems (mouth, stomach, intestines)? And what defines this moment? This linear
existence in time. Your body can move in many direction, forward and backward. In your current perception of the physical
state of matter, the relationship to time is limited to forward traversal.

-Wakes up in, apparently, the future, on a Off-World Colony funded by one of three cannabis conglomerates.
-They are the invisible hand pulling strings behind the scene.
-All space colonies are specialized.
-The one you wake up in...


-Though Earth is all "love-and-peace" and "world peace" and "civilized," the space colonies are, for the most part, like
the Wild West of the tales told by aging, door-to-door snake-oil salespeople.
-Allegedly, they're a part of the first-wave of settlers who (m?) escaped the surly bonds of gravity, on a pilgrimage to
escape persecution (and for an occupation that supports the life-style of being in an altered-state all day).


Space colonies were intended to specialize in manufacturing/cultivating raw goods/consumables.
The first two hundred years of initiate establishment led to stablity/routines. Bugs have been worked out.
The colonies are self-contained, independently able to run/exist without contact from Earth.

During the two hundred years, Earth underwent major changes. Peace amongst the different countries spread as the age of
global communication blossomed. Technology developed at an exponential rate. But still there were limits. Physical limitations
on traveling/traversing long distances of space (matter travel at speed of light?) has not been overcome.

It takes (insert trip duration to travel from Earth to the moon) for supplies to reach the colonies (even though they're
independent). The last communication from Earth has children of the Colonies in a wistful state, imagining life in gravity.

Whatever happened, it happened quick (month). Earth is now polluted to the point where sunlight cannot reach the planet's surface.

The moon colony is entering a period of isolation. An island evolution effect takes place and the moon colony is eventually
very different from the Mar colony, which is different from the etc., and Earthlings also develop minute differences compared
to the moon farmers.





Time:
-Distance future where the cybernetic-prosthetic-enhancements industry (down to three mega corporations of the
EurAsia continent) is seen as becoming obsolete. Development of Western gene-editting-technology has enable lab-grown
(functional) tissues (skeletal-muscular system) created from a sample collect of the client's cells (in terms of immune
system rejection, this procedure of biosynthetic engineering is generally accepted as being far safer than augmenting the
body with foreign components). A fierce advertising war between the cyborg and bio-splicer (like the visible mushroom
part of fungus or glacier) sets the stage for global war.



Separation/compartmentalization/encapsulation:
-societal role (butcher) enabled the separation of guilt arising from raising/killing live-stocks the masses to a few
individuals who developed specialization at such a skill/service.
-growing crops has also been separated from the layman's consciousness.
-photosynthesis is no longer the dominate process of acquiring/fixing carbon atoms.
-chemosynthesis has been developed out of necessity (extreme levels of atmospheric pollutant prevented sunlight from
 reaching plants), it was the result of the collaborative efforts of the brightest minds of all the world's countries.
 The infrastructure of

Starting point:
-Plateua that is so isolated it's virtually untouched by time. (homeage to "The Lost World")
-Explorer had followed whispers/rumors/folktales and gone in search of the plateua; and returned with cannabis seeds.
-Explorer being chased, gives seeds to player1 (the son of an inn keeper) before dying. (homeage to "Treasure Island")
