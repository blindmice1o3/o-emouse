Genetic editing tools and technology such as CRISPR-Cas9 initially allowed humans the opportunity to alter sequences of
germ-line cell (as oppose to somatic cells) for whole-system-level changes; suddenly, instances of humans contain genetic
sequences (group of statements stored as methods/functions) not found in its parent, but across the horizontal branches of
the hierarchical tree.


"Symbiosis (Wikipedia): In a cleaning symbiosis, the clownfish feeds on small invertebrates that otherwise have potential
to harm the sea anemone, and the fecal matter from the clownfish provides the nutrients to the sea anemone. The clownfish
is protected from predators by the anemone's stinging cells, to which the clownfish is immune. The clownfish emits a high
pitched sound that deters butterfly fish, which would otherwise eat the anemone, making the relationship appear mutualistic."
