    -----     -----     -----
    ADAPTER pattern: converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Lets classes work together
        that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
    -----     -----     -----

    -----     -----     -----
    FACADE pattern: provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level
        interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
