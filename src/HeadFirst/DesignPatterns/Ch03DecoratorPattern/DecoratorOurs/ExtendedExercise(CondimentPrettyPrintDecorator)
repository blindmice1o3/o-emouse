Q. Can decorators know about the other decorations in the chain? Say, I wanted my getDescription() method to print
"Whip, Double Mocha" instead of "Mocha, Whip, Mocha"? That would require that my outermost decorator know all the
decorators it is wrapping.

A. Decorators are meant to add behavior to the object they wrap. When you need to peek at multiple layers into the
decorator chain, you are starting to push the decorator beyond its true intent. Nevertheless, such things are possible.
Imagine a CondimentPrettyPrint decorator that parses the final description and can print "Mocha, Whip, Mocha" as "Whip,
Double Mocha." Note that getDescription() could return an ArrayList of descriptions to make this easier.
