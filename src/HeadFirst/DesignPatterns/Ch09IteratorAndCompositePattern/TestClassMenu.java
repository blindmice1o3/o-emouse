    -----     -----     -----
    ITERATOR pattern: provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its
        underlying representation.
    -----     -----     -----

    -----     -----     -----
    COMPOSITE pattern: allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite
        lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
