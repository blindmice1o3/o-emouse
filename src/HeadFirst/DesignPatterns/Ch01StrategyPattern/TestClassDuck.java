    Duck class started as superclass with methods: quack(), swim(), [abstract] display(), OTHER duck-like methods.
    Duck has subclassses (MallardDuck, RedheadDuck) that inherit the above methods, and provide unique implementation of display().

    Then change from management: ducks should be able to fly().

    Try adding fly() to the superclass (Duck), inheritance provides ALL subclasses of Duck to have fly().
    Problem: not all subclasses of Duck (RubberDuck) can/should fly (yet they'll inherit fly()), also quack() is different (squeak).

    Try overriding both quack() and fly() for RubberDuck.
    Problem: what about DecoyWoodenDuck? Shouldn't fly, but should quack when quack().

    Try overriding just fly() for DecoyWoodenDuck.
    Problem: what about ModelDuck? Shouldn't fly, and no noise (not even squeak) when quack().

    Try overriding both quack() and fly() for ModelDuck too.
    Problem: reuse and maintenance.

    Try creating Interface Quackable, Flyable; have subclasses of Duck decide to implements those interfaces or not.
    Problem: same issue with maintenance (just in a different form); what if implementation for fly() changes for 48 Duck subclasses?
        48 places to change code.

    *****
    Try creating Interface QuackBehavior, FlyBehavior; instead of subclasses of Duck implementing these interfaces, they
        will be compose with QuackBehavior quackBehavior (a set of classes that implement the QuackBehavior interface)
        and FlyBehavior flyBehavior (a set of classes that implement the FlyBehavior interface) instance variables to
        delegate its flying and quacking behavior; each subclasses of Duck will have constructor that will set the
        concrete subclass of QuackBehavior, FlyBehavior interfaces.
    Problem: we're still programming to an implementation in the constructors (making new() instance of concrete Quack implementation class).
