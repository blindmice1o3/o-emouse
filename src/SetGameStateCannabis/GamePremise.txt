EurAsia continent) is seen as becoming obsolete. Development of Western gene-editting-technology has enable lab-grown
(functional) tissues (skeletal-muscular system) created from a sample collect of the client's cells (in terms of immune
system rejection, this procedure of biosynthetic engineering is generally accepted as being far safer than augmenting the
body with foreign components). A fierce advertising war between the cyborg and bio-splicer (like the visible mushroom
part of fungus or glacier) sets the stage for global war.

Separation/compartmentalization/encapsulation:
